enables the manual exploration of the states of a model starting at its initial state in a textual interface in the shell. 'trace.gcf/trace.pinssim' specifies the file to load a trace from that was previously generated by LTSmin (.gcf) or explored and saved with PINSsim (.pinssim). Requirement for passing a trace here is that it starts in the initial state of the model. Navigating to another state and loading a trace that starts from that state is possible within the simulator.

== OVERVIEW OF COMMANDS 
availabe within the PINSsim textual interface:

  help                           show all options
PRINT OUT
  current                        print info of current node
  state                          print current state
  trans                          print available transitions and subsequent states
  path (states) (rw)             print path of transitions taken (with states and read-write dependencies)
  tree (states)                  print tree of transitions explored (with states)
  print2File                     print output to [FILE] (default:pinssim.out) instead to stdout
             (start) [FILE]      start printing to [FILE] (default:pinssim.out)
             (stop)              stop printing to output file
STATE EXPLORATION
  go / > [TRANSNUMBER]           take transition with TRANSNUMBER and explore potential successor states
  goback / .. (clear/keep)       go back to parent state.
                                 (and clears/keeps the state. See 'set' to change default)
  restart (clear/keep)           restart exploration from initial state
                                 (and clears/keeps the explored states. See 'set' to change default)
  load [TYPE] [FILE]             load [TYPE] information from [FILE]
       trace  [file.gcf]         load trace generated by LTSmin model checker and replays it
       trace  [file.pinssim]     load previously explored/generated trace and replays it
  save [TYPE] [FILE]             save [TYPE] information to [FILE]
       trace  [file.pinssim]     save current trace to file
  replay [ACTION]            	   replays [ACTION] if available
         trace                   replays trace previously loaded from a file
SETTINGS
  set [OPTION] [VALUE]           Set OPTION to VALUE. OPTIONS:
      loopDetection              true/false - default: false
      clearMemOnGoBack           true/false - default: false
      clearMemOnRestart          true/false - default: true
      restartOnTraceLoad         true/false - default: false
EXIT
  quit / q                       quit PINSsim

== PINSSIM FILE FORMAT

The .pinssim file format is for now a simple comma separated file with the follwing structure:

(length of state vector);(number of edgle lables);(number of state labels);(number of transistions in trace: n);(transition group 1);(transition group 2);...;(transition group n);

The first three are for now only used to check on load whether this trace matches the current model.
The number of transitions and the actual trace are used to extract, store and replay the trace.
